# PetitionBase 📜

🔗 **Live App:** https://danialzz.github.io/petition-dapp/

A decentralized petition platform on **Base network**. Anyone can create and sign petitions. The platform owner can moderate petitions that violate the rules.

## Features

- ✅ Anyone can create a petition with a title, description, category, and custom deadline
- ✅ Anyone can sign any open petition (one signature per wallet per petition)
- ✅ Petitions automatically close after their deadline
- ✅ Owner can remove petitions that violate platform rules (with an on-chain reason)
- ✅ Owner can transfer ownership to a new address
- ✅ All data is stored fully on-chain — transparent and permanent
